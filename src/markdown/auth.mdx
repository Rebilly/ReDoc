# Authentication

```bash
#!/bin/bash

BSDEX_API_KEY=put-your-api-key-here
BSDEX_API_SECRET=put-your-api-secret-here
DATE="`date -u '+%a, %d %b %Y %T %Z'`"
# The signature is in fact HMAC signature of a few fields, currently only "date", using your API secret.
AUTHORIZATION="hmac username=\"$BSDEX_API_KEY\", algorithm=\"hmac-sha1\", headers=\"date\", signature=\"`/bin/echo -n "date: ${DATE}" | openssl sha1 -binary -hmac "${BSDEX_API_SECRET}" | base64 `\""

curl -v \
    -H "Date: $DATE" \
    -H "ApiKey: $BSDEX_API_KEY" \
    -H "Authorization: $AUTHORIZATION" \
    -X GET "https://api-public.prelive.cex.tribe.sh/api/v1/balance"
```

> And you'll receive a response such as:

```json
[
  {
    "asset_id": "btc",
    "available": "0",
    "locked": "0"
  },
  {
    "asset_id": "eur",
    "available": "34163",
    "locked": "123"
  }
]
```

The requests are secured via Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication (HMAC).

In order to authenticate, you need to add the following headers in your HTTP requests in addition to the `Authentication` header:

| Header | Description | Example |
| ------ | ----------- | ------- |
|`Date`| Current date in RFC7231 format | Wed, 12 Aug 2020 12:49:26 UTC |
|`ApiKey`| Your API key | put-your-api-key-here |

The `Authentication` header's value has the pattern
`hmac username=<ApiKey>, algorithm="hmac-sha1", headers="date", signature="<signed_date>"`
where `signed_date` is the base64-encoded HMAC-SHA1 signature for the expression `date: <Date>`.

Have a look at the code example to understand the HMAC signing process better.

<aside class="notice">
It is important to note that the value of the <em>Date</em> header must match the signed date value.
